select * from  tvshow order by network
    ---order by will auto default into ascending order---

    How to insert a row into a certain table (in this example it would be tv show)
        insert into (tableName)
        ex: insert into tvDB.tvshow(title, genre, network) VALUES ("friends", "comedy", "NBC");

    How to do an "inner join" combining the two tables together
        ex: table tv shows and table characters

        inner join is all the stuff in the middle. 
        Right join would show all of the charaters and some of the overlapping tv shows that have those characters. 

        ex: select*from tvcharacter inner join tvshow on tvcharacter.showid = tvshow.showid
            hint: you can create "alias'" 
                ex: from tvcharacter c inner join tb show s on c.show =  s.showid
